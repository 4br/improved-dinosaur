Summers are coming around,

Warming the Sea and the Ground!

Exams are on their way..

And I not studying

Simply sitting looking out.

Today’s 28th February,

Time to Study and bury..

Ourselves in the galore of Books!

But my mind’s somewhere..

Why is this so in hurry?


I want to celebrate this Spring

I want to celebrate this Spring,

Like a fiancée plays with her Ring..

Waiting for the Good times to come,

When I can sing the songs of Fun!


I only want to enjoy the Fifteen!

This will be 10th when I will bend a little more..

This time with a full on jor

But I don’t want a 100 or 50,

I only want to enjoy the Fifteen!

With love and fun, with little a cheatin’.

I can hear the mutter of the coming Summer

Which is telling to burn a little on the Burner..

So I will nourish and destroy all the rubbish

Which has made our society a sulking ’n’ bore..

Come on now try to understand some more!


That you are the Sailor of your Future Ship!

That you are the Sailor of the future Ship!

Just hold on the command

And don’t let your Parents weep

‘Stand your Duty and tell the World,

That you are the precious star of this world!

Designed and defined to be

Nothing and nobody but you.

So I still sitting and seeing,

Come on now things are to get done,

And do it!
